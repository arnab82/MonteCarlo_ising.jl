# Monte Carlo Simulation for 2D Ising Model

## Overview

This repository contains a Julia implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation for the 2D Ising model. The Ising model is a mathematical model in statistical mechanics that describes the magnetic properties of a two-dimensional lattice of spins.

## Features

- Monte Carlo simulation of a 2D Ising model.
- Visualization of the spin configurations.
- Calculation of thermodynamic properties such as magnetization, energy, and heat capacity.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnab82/MonteCarlo_ising.jl.git
